        //     CefClient is not supported.
        //

        //     CefBrowser instances. Those events could be simple things like the
        //     change of the browser title or more complex ones like context menu
        //     events. By assigning handlers to CefClient you can control the
        //     behavior of the browser. See example.detailed.SimpleFrameExample for an example
        //     of how to use these handlers.

        //     the UI component of the instance. It can be displayed off-screen
        //     rendered or windowed rendered. To get an instance of CefBrowser you
        //     have to call the method "createBrowser()" of your CefClient
        //     instances.
        //
        //     CefBrowser has methods like "goBack()", "goForward()", "loadURL()",
        //     and many more which are used to control the behavior of the displayed
        //     content. The UI is held within a UI-Compontent which can be accessed
        //     by calling the method "getUIComponent()" on the instance of CefBrowser.

        //     anonymous ActionListener. This listener is performed each time the
        //     user presses the "ENTER" key within the address field.
